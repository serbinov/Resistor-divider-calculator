## 📋 Online Calculator

Free, professional-grade **resistor divider calculator** with comprehensive design capabilities. Perfect for power supply design, voltage regulation circuits, and precision voltage dividers.

### ✨ Calculator Features

#### Three Calculation Modes
1. **Auto Selection**: Automatically finds optimal R1/R2 combinations from standard E24/E96/E192 series
2. **Manual Input**: Calculate with specific resistor values you already have  
3. **Division Ratio**: Design based on required voltage division coefficient

#### Advanced Capabilities
- ✅ Standard resistor series support (E24, E96, E192)
- ✅ Multiple tolerance options (5%, 1%, 0.5%, 0.25%, 0.1%)
- ✅ Temperature drift analysis (PPM calculations)
- ✅ Worst-case tolerance analysis across -40°C to +85°C
- ✅ Load resistance effects calculation
- ✅ Power dissipation analysis
- ✅ Package size recommendations (SMD & Through-hole)
